## Hi there 👋

I'm [Your Name], an aspiring developer on a coding journey through the wild world of full stack development. 🚀 Currently sharpening my skills at a bootcamp, I'm learning to create magic on both the front and back end of the web (no wizard hat needed... yet).

🛠️ Technologies I'm learning:

🖼️ HTML, CSS, JavaScript – where all the frontend magic happens!

⚛️ React – because I like my UIs dynamic and snappy.

🛠️ Node.js – for building the logic behind the scenes.

🍃 MongoDB – because who needs SQL when you’ve got NoSQL? 😎


🌱 Currently working on:

Crafting a shiny portfolio to showcase my developing superpowers. ✨

Taming my first full stack app (it’s like raising a pet, but with more bugs).


📚 On the horizon:

Getting my head in the cloud (cloud computing, not daydreaming, I swear! ☁️).

Exploring advanced frameworks like Next.js. One framework to rule them all, right?


📫 Reach out:

You can find me via carrier pigeon (just kidding) – but really, [Email] or [LinkedIn Profile].


Want to collaborate? Have some advice? Or just want to geek out about code? I'm all ears (or eyes, if it's through a screen)!
